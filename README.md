# Flutter:

- Flutter is an open source mobile SDK developed by Google to build high quality applications for Android and iOS. 
- It allows developers to not only build application with beautiful design, smooth animation and fast performance, but also able to integrate new features quickly. 
- Flutter offers high velocity development with its stateful hot reload and hot restart. 
- With only one code base to manage, you get to save a lot of cost comparing to managing both Android and iOS projects as Flutter compiles it to native ARM code. 
- Flutter uses Dart programming language which is also developed by Google.

# Dart:

- A terse, strongly-typed, object-oriented language.
- Supports just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilation.
- JIT allows flutter to recompile code directly on the device while the app is still running.
- Enable fast development and enables sub-second stable hot reloading.
- AOT allows code to be compiled directly into native ARM code leading to fast startup and predictable performance.
